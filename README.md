# WoW-Coding
A collection of files documenting my progress in learning Lua coding and how to make addons for the game 'World of Warcraft'.

I already have knowledge and experience in coding with Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a small amount of Python. I'm mainly studying Lua for the purpose of expanding my arsenal of coding knowledge, however I also hope to get to a point where I can confidently code fully functional addons for WoW, as it is my favourite game and I'd love at be able to contribute to the community in some way. 

I'm using a PDF version of the book 'World of Warcraft Programming: A Guide and Reference for Creating WoW Addons - Second Edition' by James Whitehead II as my main guide for this journey, however I will eventually expand out to other guides I find online to further advance my knowledge and skill, which I will list here as I find them.
